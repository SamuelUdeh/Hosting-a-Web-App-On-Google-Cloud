There are many ways to deploy web sites within Google Cloud. Each solution offers different features, capabilities, and levels of control. Compute Engine offers a deep level of control over the infrastructure used to run a web site, but also requires a little more operational management compared to solutions like Google Kubernetes Engines (GKE), App Engine, or others. With Compute Engine, you have fine-grained control of aspects of the infrastructure, including the virtual machines, load balancers, and more.

In this project I deployed a sample application, the "Fancy Store" ecommerce website, to show how a website can be deployed and scaled easily with Compute Engine.

In this project, you learn how to:

Create Compute Engine instances,
Create instance templates from source instances,
Create managed instance groups,
Create and test managed instance group health checks,
Create HTTP(S) Load Balancers,
Create load balancer health checks, and 
Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Caching.
